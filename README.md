## 🚀 What’s Harbr?

Harbr is not just another marketplace—it’s **a decentralized trend prediction platform** where users can:

- Bet on NFT events like floor price movements, drops, and volume surges.
- Discuss each market with other users.
- Earn MON tokens for being right.

Built on **Monad testnet**, Harbr delivers high-speed, low-cost transactions with trustless escrow smart contracts.

## 🎯 How Harbr Works

| Step | Description |
|------|-------------|
| **1. Market created** | Admins or AI identify NFT trends (e.g. "Will Milady Maker floor exceed 3 ETH?") |
| **2. Users place bets** | Stake MON into per-market pools (Yes/No). Funds are securely escrowed in the contract. |
| **3. Market resolution** | After the end time, the outcome is determined via oracle or admin call. |
| **4. Claim payouts** | Only winners can withdraw proportionally from the total liquidity pool. |

**Payout example:** If 1,000 MON is staked on the correct side within a 5,000 MON total pool, a 50 MON stake yields 250 MON (your 50 MON + 200 MON profit).
